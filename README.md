## The Summary
### The code can be reuse for future elections as long as the variables are replaced with the new ones. Even when adding more options, it will not affect how the code works. The script will be easy to manage as many of the hard coding is taken out so the syntax can run on its own. When the script is reused in the future, the generate results label and information needs to be swap out for the new details.
